# last2
### [View solution](solution/)  

Given a string, return the count of the number of times that a substring length 2 appears in the string and also as the last 2 chars of the string, so "hixxxhi" yields 1 (we won't count the end substring).  

last2('hixxhi') → 1  
last2('xaxxaxaxx') → 1  
last2('axxxaaxx') → 2  

```
function last2(str) {
    // enter your code here

}
```
