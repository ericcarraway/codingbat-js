# array667
### [View solution](solution/)  
Given an array of ints, return the number of times that two 6's are next to each other in the array. Also count instances where the second "6" is actually a 7.

array667([6, 6, 2]) → 1  
array667([6, 6, 2, 6]) → 1  
array667([6, 7, 2, 6]) → 1  

```
function array667(nums) {
    // enter your code here

}
```
